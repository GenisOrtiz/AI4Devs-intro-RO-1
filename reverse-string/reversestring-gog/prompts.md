Prompts:
1) Can you help me build an HTML page containing one title in bold, one text input field, and a button?
2) I would like to reverse the input text and show it to another label, all managed by JavaScript.
3) This time, I want the button to be invisible until the introduced text has at least 3 characters, and then make it visible.
4) One last modification. Add another label that shows the input text reversed immediately after it was typed.
